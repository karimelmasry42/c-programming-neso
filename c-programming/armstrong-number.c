 * 
 * An Armstrong number of order n is a number in which each digit when
 * multiplied by itself n number of times and finally added together, results
 * the same number.
 *
 * For example:
 * 371 is a 3 digit number. Therefore, its order is 3 Now here, each digit is
 * multiplied by itself 3 times and finally added together and results in our
 * original number
 * i.e. 3*3*3 + 7*7*7 + 1*1*1 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371
